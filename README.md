# Combuctor Scrap :moneybag:
Marks all junk items in [Combuctor](https://github.com/tullamods/Combuctor) panels according to [Scrap](https://github.com/Jaliborc/Scrap) and provides a junk ruleset.
Logically, it requires both [Combuctor](https://github.com/tullamods/Combuctor) and [Scrap](https://github.com/Jaliborc/Scrap) to work.
